# Raspberry Pi Project
## Discord bot
### Student Number 2652035

#### Introduction
At first when I got the Raspberry Pi, I wondered what I could really do something useful with it.
My first idea was to make a guitar tuner about espeak, but that idea was quickly scrapped for time reasons, so I built a little bot based on twitch that can automatically scan for swear and block them, and time out or post messages to the chat when certain words are spoken after, but unfortunately the twitch API was fully revised at the end of February that my code is totally not working ,so finally I ended up making a discord bot which can greeting too you,add two numbers,check system and user's info,get your ip address and show picture of pepega.

### Physical - Construction
The Raspberry Pi basiclly is a micro-computer than runs an operating system known as Raspbian (which is a Linux (Debian) distro).
In this project we will be using the piOS lite version, which means there is no GUI for the whole system, so it is necessary to enter your wifi information on the boot disk (SD card), but the mobile hotspot on IOS has to reboot the hotspot every time it connects resulting in the unavailability of other devices.

### Virtual - The Code
Update the latest system firmware with the python version, download the discord firmware and you are ready to program in python
 bot.py covers all the features introduced in the introduction, but before this can be done a bot application needs to be registered with the discord developer to join the server and use TOKEN to make the connection between the bot and the Raspberry Pi.
### Ideas for Version 2
For time reasons, playing music and checking steam prices were not successfully implemented, so this will be a feature that will be added in version 2. After that, the bot will also implement different unique features such as playing YouTube videos, playing bilibili videos (a Chinese video & anime website), rock-paper-scissors and some other interesting features.

### Conclusion
 the vodafone carrier doesn't support internet connections for apps like discord, so I switched to another carrier hotspot to test the bot availability and it finally works,here's my discord server with the bot which you can totally join:
